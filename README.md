MVVMSearchPicfieAsif is Android App to search images receiveed from Unsplash API.


## Built With ðŸ› 
* [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) - Official programming language for Android Development
* [Coroutines](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/coroutines-overview.html) - For asynchronous
* [Android Architecture Components](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture) - Collection of libraries that help you design robust, testable, and maintainable apps.
* [Jetpack DataStore](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/datastore) - etpack DataStore is a data storage solution that allows you to store key-value pairs or typed objects with protocol buffers. DataStore uses Kotlin coroutines and Flow to store data asynchronously, consistently, and transactionally
  * [LiveData](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/livedata) - Data objects that notify views when the underlying database changes.
  * [ViewModel](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/viewmodel) - Stores UI-related data that isn't destroyed on UI changes.
